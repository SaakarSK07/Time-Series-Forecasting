# Time-Series-Forecasting
The purpose of this project is to anticipate future changes in energy consumption in Turkey using three popular time series models: the Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS), the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA). The dataset contains hourly data on energy consumption from January 1, 2016, through August 2020. Accurate forecasting of energy consumption trends is critical for effective energy sector planning, management, and policy implementation.

Each model was chosen for its distinct characteristics in time series analysis. The ETS model excels at capturing trend and seasonality components, the ARIMA model is adaptable to varied time series patterns, and the SARIMA model excels at capturing complicated seasonal patterns. The forecasting effectiveness of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which are constructed and calibrated using historical data. A comparison of the three models is performed to determine the best forecasting strategy for projecting future trends in Turkey's energy consumption. The proposed model will allow energy stakeholders to make better decisions by optimizing resource allocation and reducing the risk of energy shortages or surpluses. This research intends to help Turkey manage its energy resources more efficiently, while also encouraging sustainable development and limiting overall environmental damage.
